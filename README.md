This project is done to test Automated script for Dat Shopping List
It covers using Selenium WebDriver with Behave. Behave is very similar to Lettuce, in that it allows for tests to be written in a natural language style, but it does seem a bit simpler to use and setup. We will also make use of Nose for its assertions.
This framework is built in python 3.10 

Installation
do a git clone and then pip install from the command line/terminal
To run Test: behave features/shoppingList.feature
